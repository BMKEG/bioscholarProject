The flex-dot-* files contain the information needed in Unix hidden 
files that start with "." like ".project".  We don't want to store
the actual ".project", etc. files in the repository because details
of those files differ from installation to installation because pathnames
and locations of the working copies are different.  So we provide
these templates that can be renamed and modified locally.

By not keeping the real files in the repository, we avoid thrashing and
having updates and commits interfere with other programmer's settings.
