BioScholar System
===

The 'BioScholar' system was first described in our BMC Bioinformatics paper ([Russ et al. 2011](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/351)) as the first full implementation of a KEfED model. ('KEfED' stands for 'Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design' and is our approach to represent experimental observations with little or no additional domain-specific interpretation). **BioScholar** itself, is intended to be an experimental knowledge management system curated from the scientific literature and specifically targeted to support early-stage biomedical researchers (graduate students and postdocs) in facing the very first research challenge that they face: making sense of the very largesse amount of existing knowledge in the literature..
